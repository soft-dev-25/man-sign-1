# Fake Data Generator Frontend

## Purpose
Frontent for the [Fake Data Generator](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/fake_info), which generates fake data of nonexistent Danish persons.

## Installation

The backend is expected to be running at `http://localhost/php_fake_info`, but this value can be changed at `info.js`.

If changeing the url in `info.js` doesn't work - Keep the changes in the file, but open the frontend in another browser.
